    "explanation": "The payments table's amount column has suddenly shifted from having virtually no null values (0% baseline) to 44.63% null values, indicating a systemic data quality failure affecting nearly half of all payment records being ingested.",
    "root_cause": "ETL process failure in amount field extraction or transformation - likely a breaking change in upstream source system schema, a failed column mapping in the transformation logic, or a corrupted/disabled data source connector that is writing NULL values instead of actual payment amounts.",
    "fixes": [
      "Immediately check the upstream source system (payment processor API, database export, or file feed) for schema changes, data format changes, or connection failures that occurred at or before 2026-02-20T03:19:38",
      "Review ETL job logs for the payments pipeline execution around the detection timestamp to identify transformation errors, failed lookups, or null-handling logic that activated",
      "Run a manual validation query comparing row counts with non-null amount values before and after 2026-02-20T03:00:00 to identify the exact timestamp of failure and scope of affected records",
      "Temporarily implement upstream data validation to reject or quarantine records with null amount values and send alerts to the data engineering team before they reach the warehouse"
