    "explanation": "The payments table's amount column has suddenly gone from 0% null values to 44.3% null values, indicating a critical data ingestion or transformation failure that is allowing NULL amounts to be written to production.",
    "root_cause": "ETL pipeline failure in the payment amount field mapping or calculation step, likely a NULL coalescing function that stopped executing, a JOIN condition that became too restrictive causing unmatched rows to default to NULL, or a data source API returning empty values that are no longer being filtered.",
    "fixes": [
      "Immediately check the ETL job logs for the payments table pipeline executed between 2026-02-21 and 2026-02-22 08:28 UTC for errors in the amount field transformation step",
      "Verify the data source feed (upstream API, database query, or file upload) is still returning valid amount values and hasn't changed its schema or null-handling behavior",
      "Query the payments table for rows inserted in the last 24 hours with NULL amounts and cross-reference their source IDs against the upstream system to identify which records failed during transformation"
